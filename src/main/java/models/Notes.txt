Notes

A goal has a name, a list of strategies and a list of measures.
A strategy has a
Example:
    Goal: Achieve a healthy and fit lifestyle [ID - #1]
    Strategies:
        [1] Loose weight and develop healthy eating habits [Attached to goal ID #1]
        [ID #1]
        Key: 1-1
        [2] Workout at the gym [Attached to goal ID #1]
        [ID #2]
        Key: Key 1-2
    Measures:
        [1] Calorie deficit, 1500 calories a day [Attached to goal ID #1 and strategy ID #1]
        Key: 1-1-1
        [2] Workout a total of 3 times per week [Attached to goal ID #1 and strategy ID #2]
        Key: 1-2-1

Start by thoroughly defining your data model (Goal, Strategy, Measure, Progress) with their attributes and relationships. This will guide the rest of your development.
Repository (repository package):

Create the GoalRepository class to handle database interactions.
Define methods for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on your Goal objects and related entities.
Implement these methods using SQLite JDBC to interact with your database.
Service (service package):

Create the GoalService class to implement the core logic of your application.
Define methods for:
Adding a new goal with its strategies and measures.
Retrieving goals and their associated data.
Updating goal information.
Recording progress for a goal.
Calculating progress based on the latest recorded values and target.
The service methods will use the GoalRepository to interact with the database.
Controller (controller package):

Create the GoalController class to handle requests from the Vaadin UI.
Define methods to handle user actions, such as:
"Add Goal" request: Get the goal details from the UI, create the Goal object, and call the GoalService to save it.
"View Goals" request: Fetch goals from the GoalService and pass them to the UI for display.
"Record Progress" request: Get the progress data from the UI, and call the GoalService to store it.
"View Progress" request: Fetch progress data and calculated progress from the GoalService and pass it to the UI.
Vaadin UI (ui package):

Create the Vaadin views (MainView, GoalListView, GoalDetailView).
Design the UI using Vaadin components (buttons, text fields, grids, etc.).
Implement event listeners to handle user interactions (button clicks, form submissions).
Connect the UI events to the GoalController methods.
Testing (test package):

Write unit tests for your repository, service, and controller classes to ensure they function correctly.
Consider writing integration tests to test the interactions between different components.
Refinement and Iteration:

Once you have a basic working application, refine the UI, add more features, and improve the user experience.
Continuously test and iterate on your code to ensure quality and maintainability.
